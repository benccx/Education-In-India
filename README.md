# Education-In-India
I'm doing my analysis of the literacy rate in Indian states and how it depends on the state's education indicators. I will be following dataset of Elementary state Report cards (2015-2016) from DISC 2001 http://udise.in/src.htm and will be marking my steps throughout the notebook and also put some set of questions.
